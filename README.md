# Survey-Form-
The project you completed, "Build a Survey Form," is part of the Responsive Web Design certification from freeCodeCamp. It involves creating a survey form that is fully responsive, meaning it adjusts to different screen sizes and devices. Here's a breakdown of what this project typically involves:

Project Requirements:
Form Elements: You are required to include a variety of input fields such as text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown menus to collect user data.

Labels: Every input element should be properly labeled for accessibility, ensuring users know what each field is for.

Form Validation: The form should have some form of validation, meaning the user must provide specific information before submitting (like ensuring email is in the correct format).

Responsive Design: The form must be visually appealing on all screen sizes, adapting to devices like mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

CSS Styling: You apply custom CSS to style the form, ensuring it looks clean and professional.

Steps to Complete:
Structure: You create the HTML structure for the form, including the header, the form itself with the input fields, and the submit button.

Form Fields: You use input types like text, email, radio, checkbox, and select for dropdowns, to collect responses from users.

Styling: Using CSS, you style the form elements and make sure the form looks good across different devices by making it responsive.

Validation: Optionally, you can add form validation to ensure users fill in the form correctly.

Testing: You ensure the form works across different screen sizes and devices, with proper feedback on submission.

Once completed, your project is a functional survey form that can collect user input and display it properly, along with the visual responsiveness that adapts across devices.
